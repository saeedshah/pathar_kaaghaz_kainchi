/* ---------------------------------------------
 * File: rockPaperScissors.java
 * It's a simple game called Rock-Paper-Scissors: 
 * Assignment given by Usman Kirmani
 * --------------------------------------------
 * program flow sequence:
 * 1- ask user how many rounds they want to play. (min 2, max 10 rounds - just to keep it simple)
 * 2- ask user to input their choice - Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
 * 3- get computer to make a counter choice randomly. (using a built-in Random method)
 * 4- compare user-input vs computer-input and decide winner of the round. 
 * 5- after final round, compare user vs computer score and declare winner of the match.
